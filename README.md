PROJECT - In United States, there are many stores in which a survey was conducted based on students i.e.
how much they are spending on different kind of purchases like Video games, Indoor games, Toys,
Books, Gadgets etc. In the data set (Student Survey), Store setting is the column that explains the Type
of location in which the store is present. By using data set (Student Survey), try to extract the
meaningful Insights.

[Industry Type – Retail Store]

Data set - Student survey

1. [Tabular Visualization] - Formatted the total amount of purchase (TAP) based on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store
setting’: -
               If 0<TAP<35000, then records are in red color
               If 35000<=TAP<60000, then records are in yellow color
               If TAP>=60000, then records are in Blue color
2 [Matrix Visualization] – Created Matrix Visualization to show the amount spent on Outdoor sports across
different ages and ‘Store setting’. Done the color formatting for the amount spent in total outdoor sports.
3. [Funnel chart] – Created a Funnel chart to show Total amount of purchase by ‘Store setting’. Showed the
data labels as Percentage of First.
4. [Pie chart] – Showed the total amount of purchase by different ‘Store location’ for Suburban ‘Store setting’
only by using Filter context.
5. a) [Scatter plot] - Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across the different ages.
   b) [Sand dance plot] - Indoor sports and Video games spent across the different age groups.
6. Restricted data access for the given users in User mapping table. For ex. Mani deals with Rural area only
so she should be able to view the data which belongs to Rural only, not urban and suburban data.
7. Published the report on Power BI cloud service and Designed the Master Dashboard consisting of Funnel
chart and scatter plots. Then created a schedule refresh for six times in every 4 hours for the Dashboard in
a day.
8. Used Q&A feature of Power BI –
   a) To show average age of students
   b) Donut chart for total amount of purchases by ‘Store location’
